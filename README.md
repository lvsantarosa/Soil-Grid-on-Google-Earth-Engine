# Global Soil Grid (250 m) on Google Earth Engine 

SoilGrids and WoSIS
Soilgrids is a system for digital soil mapping based on a global compilation of soil profile data (WoSIS) and environmental layers. Read about the SoilGrids and WoSIS projects on isric.org

### Important notice
SoilGrids is designed as a globally consistent, data-driven system that predicts soil properties and classes using global covariates and globally fitted models. If you are looking for soil information on national and/or local levels we advise you, before using SoilGrids, to compare SoilGrids predictions with soil maps derived from national and local soil geographical databases. National soil maps are usually based on more detailed input soil information and therefore are often more accurate than SoilGrids (within the local coverage area). For an overview of national and regional soil databases, please refer to the Soil Geographic Databases compendium.

The selection of soil profiles underpinning SoilGrids is larger than the publicly available set ('wosis_latest') displayed here (for details see the ESSD paper). The actual number of observations for each property varies (greatly) between profiles and with depth, generally depending on the objectives of the initial soil sampling programmes. National soil survey organisations will generally maintain a wider selection of soil profiles/properties for their country in their databases.

### Data license and terms of use
This version of SoilGrids is available to you by ISRIC — World Soil Information under the CC-BY 4.0 License. Alternatively, the CC BY licence for individual profiles/properties is indicated in 'wosis_latest'. By using the ISRIC website and web services the user accepts those licenses and the ISRIC data policy in full.
